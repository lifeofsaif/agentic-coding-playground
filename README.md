>Note: This is a VS Code Remote Containers development project: all development is done within a container to reduce initial time-to-develop. Getting this project up and running on your machine can be as simple as pulling down the repository, running the Docker,and clicking twice in VS Code. Additionally, this is Codespaces compatible.

## Prerequisites

- Docker for Desktop
- VS Code Extensions: [Remote Containers](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Directions

1. Open the repository in VS Code `code <repo filename>`.
